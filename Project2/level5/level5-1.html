    <div id="container"><span class="fire">Fire</span> and <span class="ice">Ice</span> Some say the world will end in <span class="fire">fire</span>, Some say in <span class="ice">ice</span>. From what I&rsquo;ve tasted of <span class="fire">desire</span> I hold with those who favor <span class="fire">fire</span>. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of <span class="ice">hate</span> To know that for destruction <span class="ice">ice</span> Is also great And would suffice.
