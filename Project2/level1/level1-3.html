    <p>Fire<br> 
        and<br>
        Ice<br>
    </p>
    <p>Some<br> 
        say<br> 
        the<br> 
        world<br> 
        will<br> 
        end<br>
        in<br>
        fire, <br>
        Some <br>
        say <br>
        in <br>
        ice. <br>
        From <br>
        what <br>
        I&rsquo;ve<br> 
        tasted <br>
        of <br>
        desire <br>
        I <br>
        hold <br>
        with <br>
        those <br>
        who <br>
        favor <br>
        fire. <br>
        But <br>
        if <br>
        it <br>
        had <br>
        to <br>
        perish <br>
        twice, <br>
        I <br>
        think <br>
        I <br>
        know <br>
        enough <br>
        of <br>
        hate <br>
        To <br>
        say <br>
        that <br>
        for <br>
        destruction<br> 
        ice <br>
        Is <br>
        also <br>
        great <br>
        And <br>
        would <br>
        suffice.<br>
